Hi there, Wellcome to my homepage!

I am recently an Application Engineer at **STMicroelectronics** (Shenzhen). My team mainly focus on Industrial Automation and Smart Home/Building Automation

I received the Master degree from **Xidian University**, China. I spent a wonderful time working closely with Prof. [Lei Quan](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/quanlei/) and Prof. [Kai Xie](https://faculty.xidian.edu.cn/XK3/zh_CN/index.htm) at [GATE](https://faculty.xidian.edu.cn/XK3/zh_CN/index.htm) Lab.

Previously, I received the B.E. degree from Xidian University, China.
