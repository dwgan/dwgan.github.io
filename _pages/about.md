I am currently a third year Master student in [Group of Aerospace Technology in Electronics (GATE)](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/kaixie/) Lab, at [School of Aerospace Science and Technology (SAST)](https://sast.xidian.edu.cn/) in [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/), majoring in Instrument Science and Technology. Before, I received my Bachelor degree (2020) from the same school of Xidian University. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Associate Prof. Quan Lei](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/quanlei/), and I work closely with [Prof. Xie Kai](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/kaixie/).
