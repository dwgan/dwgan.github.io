Hi there, Wellcome to my homepage!

I am recently an Application Engineer at STMicroelectronics (Shenzhen).

I received the Master degree from Xidian University, China. I spent a wonderful time working closely with Prof. [Lei Quan](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/quanlei/) and Prof. [Kai Xie](https://faculty.xidian.edu.cn/XK3/zh_CN/index.htm) at [GATE](https://faculty.xidian.edu.cn/XK3/zh_CN/index.htm) Lab.

Previously, I received the B.E. degree from Xidian University, China.
