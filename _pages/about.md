Hi there, wellcome to my homepage!

My name is **Dongwen Gan** (**甘东文**).

I am recently a System Application Engineer at **STMicroelectronics** (Shenzhen).

I received the Master degree from [**Xidian University**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xidian_University), China. I spent a wonderful time working closely with Prof. Lei Quan and Prof. Kai Xie at [GATE](https://faculty.xidian.edu.cn/XK3/zh_CN/index.htm) Lab.

Previously, I received the B.E. degree from Xidian University, China. 

My research interest includes **Deep Learning**, **Compressed Sensing**, **Wireless Communication**，**Internet of Things**, and **Embedded Development**

# Research Interest

My research is primarily centered around two key areas: **Deep Learning** and the **Internet of Things (IoT)**. I am deeply passionate about advancing the capabilities of neural networks through innovative models, as well as contributing to the development of smart home technologies using cutting-edge IoT solutions. These two fields represent the forefront of technology, driving both the evolution of artificial intelligence and the realization of intelligent, interconnected environments.

## Deep Learning

I am currently focused on exploring new models, such as Mamba, to replace traditional Transformer-based architectures. My goal is to achieve more efficient representation and reduced complexity in neural networks. My research particularly targets vision tasks like image compressed sensing, where the objective is to recover higher quality images using fewer samples, requiring enhanced expressive power in neural networks.

## Internet of Things

As a System Application Engineer at ST, I specialize in IoT applications for smart homes, with a primary focus on advancing the IoT ecosystem. One key area of our work is promoting the KNX standard, a leading international protocol in smart home automation that ensures seamless compatibility and plug-and-play functionality across devices. We’ve developed various demos to showcase the integration of ST’s products, such as STM32 microcontrollers, communication interface chips, KNX protocol chips, IO-Link protocol chips, edge AI sensors, DC-DC converters, and energy harvesting chips. Our demos include smart charging stations, mini IoT houses, photovoltaic energy storage and harvesting, IoT sensors, KNX-based smart building management systems, and solutions for remote network monitoring and intranet penetration.
