Hi there, Wellcome to my homepage! 

I am currently a third-year Master's student in [_Group of Aerospace Technology in Electronics_](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/kaixie/) (GATE) Lab, at [_School of Aerospace Science and Technology_](https://sast.xidian.edu.cn/) (SAST) in [_Xidian University_](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/), majoring in _Instrument Science and Technology_. I am very fortunate to be advised by Associate Prof. [Lei Quan](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/quanlei/) (权磊). I spent wonderful moments working closely with Prof. Lei Quan and Prof. [Kai Xie](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/kaixie/) (谢楷).

Before, I obtained my Bachelor's degree (2020) from _Xidian University_.
